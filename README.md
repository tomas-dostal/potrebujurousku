## Long time ago...

Back in the days when the COVID pandemic struck in 2020, there was a need for some sort
of website that would help summarize the chaotic regulations from ministries. This
project was alive for only a few months, and what you can see now is a tombstone of
something I put a bit of my heart into. Now I see all the imperfections, and I would
build it from scratch differently, but at least it was a very valuable lesson to me. I
would like to express my gratitude to anyone who contributed in any way to this project.
Thank you very much, and I am very happy that the whole pandemic thing is over now.

Below, you can find a bit of the backstory (CZ) of how everything happened and how
things worked, etc.
